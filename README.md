How it works:

Project Title: Port Scanner for Pentesting

This project involves developing a multi-threaded port scanner using Python to enhance penetration testing workflows. The tool allows users to scan a range of ports on a target IP address efficiently by leveraging Python's ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent execution. It provides customizable options, such as specifying the number of threads and port ranges, enabling flexibility for different network scenarios. The scanner identifies open ports on the target, which can aid in discovering running services and assessing network security. This lightweight and user-friendly tool is designed with ethical considerations, emphasizing its use on authorized networks or with explicit permission for security assessments.
